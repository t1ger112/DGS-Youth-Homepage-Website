GDS Youth-Homepage Website

For Inversity Challenge #4 sponsored by GDS of PUBLIC, I have created a Youth-Homepage website designed to offer an easily scalable and modifiable webpage that provides many government services related to Young-Adults. This is a dedicated webpage lacking from the GOV.uk website, and after the chatbot reiterating this point, I chose it as my problem to solve for the set challenge.

The site consists of two HTML and CSS files that are linked to produce a single webpage inspired by the GOV.uk website. My webpage is very clean and simplistic to mimic this, and utilises a similar colour scheme as the real government website.

This webpage has been coded entirely by hand in "Visual Studio Code" and utilises all of my pre-existing web-development skills, and has also urged me to research and implement many new skills learnt from 'W3Schools.com', especially around CSS styles formatting.

There are 3 svg graphics used to enhance the visual aspects of the site, and help it mimic its GOV.uk inspiration that are not created solely by me:

 - topbar crown icon [class="logo"] ~ courtesey of: "https://GOV.uk" website
 - arrow on buttons [class="default-button"] courtesey of: "https://GOV.uk" website
 - topbar search icon [class="search"] ~ courtesey of: "https://iconsvg.xyz" website

My website takes heavy inspiration from the government website, but may contain some drastic differences in the visual styling, as I am unable to create a more complicated site due to timescale and skill constrainsts. The only features of the site that do not function as a result of this are the "menu" and "search" top-bar navigation buttons. The website itself is designed to be easily scalable, with specific government services being added in dedicated modules of code, and a related "bookmark" link to it created in the page contents section at the top of the site.
